# Testing

## Code Validation

- Pust yoga and mindfulness website has been thoroughly tested. All of the code has been run through the W3C HTML Validator and the W3C CSS Validator. errors were found on the home, support, and technique, as well as a warning.

Some of the errors have been fixed, except for the warning on. mostly because of the lack of time and not knowing how to fix them.
